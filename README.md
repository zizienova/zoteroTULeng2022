=====================================================================



### Which documents can be cited:

The style is adapted for the types of documents most frequently cited by TUL students, as defined in *Citation Guidelines* (viz https://dspace.tul.cz/bitstream/handle/15240/172152/citation_guidelines%2020230530.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). These are:

- books

- chapters

- articles

- theses

- legislation (laws, decrees, bulletins, EU legislation)

- standards

- musical notations

- maps

- patents

- conference posters

- websites

- webpages

- emails

- social media posts

- videos

- datasets

- software

- lectures

- discussions

- images

- encyclopedia articles, dictionary entries

==================================================================



### For which document types the style is not adapted:

For the following documents the citation style is not set, a reference will be created but may not conform to the rules: 

~~audio recording, document, bill, podcast, radio show, TV show, case, manuscript, hearing~~. 

In case you need to cite one of these types, then apply the principle that the citations should follow the same rules and should look similar. You can also use one of the ready-made document types (see Which documents can be cited).

======================================================================



### What the citation style cannot do and therefore must be edited manually:

Some rules in the *Citation Guidelines* cannot be programmed. Therefore, editing must be done at the level of the metadata stored in Zotero or the rules have not been programmed. 

##### Volumes and issues for foreign language articles:

English terminology (vol. and no.) is used for foreign language articles, terminology in the language of the article (roč., č., etc.) is not applied.

##### Post time:

Zotero does not work with time; the references of social media posts and lectures contain only the full date without the hour and minute.

##### Identifiers:

Identifiers that are not defined in Zotero (i.e., ISAN, ISMN, ISRC, ISRN, ISWC, and arXiv ID) must be entered in the Extra field in the form ISAN: 478656576

Note that the arXiv identifier must be capitalized, i.e. ARXIV and still in the Extra field, e.g. ARXIV: 769986765647

##### Availability:

Distributor is used only for some document types.

##### Maps:

The map edition and the subject area are not incorporated into the style.

##### Patents:

Zotero does not work with the Assignee and Country fields. The owner of a patent that is downloaded to the Assignee field must be copied to the Contributor field. The code from the Country field needs to be copied to the Place field.
The role of the author is expressed by the conjunction (inventor/inventors).
The order of the inventors' names is the same as for the editors, i.e. the first inventor is in inverted form. 

##### Other data that will be stored when downloading metadata:

There is a lot of other metadata that will be downloaded to Zotero. These data should not affect the resulting reference. Of course, if you are not working with the data, it is preferable to delete it and keep the metadata cleaned up.

=======================================================================
